    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Drone Simulation Project Overview
========================================================================

This project demonstrates a simplified 3D simulation of how a delivery truck and drone would work in unision to help deliver packages to different addresses. The environment is created in a 3D space using C++ and openGL. 

Red Cube simulates a delivery truck

Blue Sphere simulates a delivery drone

Green Squares simulate grass

Grey squares simulate street

Brown boxes simulate a house

Blue lines simulate the path in which the Delivery truck and drone are traveling on

Currently, there is no collision or spacial awareness for the drone.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your Drone application.


CrowdSim.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

CrowdSim.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

CrowdSim.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named CrowdSim.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
